CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findorocos_kdl.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "orocos_kdl", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "orocos_kdl" with
  any of the following names:

    orocos_kdlConfig.cmake
    orocos_kdl-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "orocos_kdl" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "orocos_kdl_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "orocos_kdl" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
